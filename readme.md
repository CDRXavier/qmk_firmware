# Xavier's fork of the Framework QMK Firmware

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [Framework's fork of QMK firmware](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/qmk_firmware/tree/fl16-bisect).

Currently, it is based on the FL16-bisect branch.

### Pre-compiled firmware download

You *can* compile the binary yourself. But you can also not.
Compiled binary is available at folder "[UF2](/UF2)".

### Notable Changes
1. Disables Via (disables any functionality through the Framework online interface)
2. Keyboard specific:
   * Numpad: Backlight breathing toggle now go to "`Esc` + `=`"
   * Numpad: Backlight brightness toggle now go to "`Esc` + `⟵`"

## Documentation

For QMK help, [see the official documentation on docs.qmk.fm](https://docs.qmk.fm).

To enter bootloader mode, on:
Large keyboards: Press `Left Alt` and `Right Alt` while turning on.
Numpad/RGB numpad: Press "`1`" and "`6`" at the same time.

To upload firmware, copy and paste any `.uf2` binary into the USB drive. Once done, the device will restart.

If you are switching over from mainline framework firmware, you must clear the flash first.



### Clearing the flash

The first time you flash the firmware, you must first uplaod the `EraseFlash.uf2`. This will take a while. This is because the previous Via-enabled firmware will write a key map onto emulated EEPROM, overriding the mapping of our modified firmware.

After clearing the flash, the keyboard(s) will appear in bootloader mode.

## Supported Keyboards

* [Framework ANSI](/keyboards/framework/ansi)
* [Framework ANSI with CoPilot](/keyboards/framework/copilot)
* [Framework ISO](/keyboards/framework/iso)
* [Framework JIS](/keyboards/framework/jis)
* [Framework clear](/keyboards/framework/KLE)
* [Framework macropad](/keyboards/framework/macropad)
* [Framework Numpad](/keyboards/framework/numpad)

Support for all other community keyboards are removed; this is only for the Framework 16. For others, see [Main QMK Github](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)

# Known Issues

If you ever encountered a build issue saying 
```
⚠ "git describe --abbrev=6 --dirty --always --tags" returned error code 128
⚠ "git describe --abbrev=6 --dirty --always --tags" returned error code 128

QMK have known issue of "forgetting" the correct config. See [issue](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/249660 on QMK Firmware.
